<hr/>
<p> To run the tests, you need to enter <strong><em>mvn test</em></strong> in the terminal </p>
<p> <strong> NB! </strong> If Maven throws errors when trying to build or test, please, change the version of your Java to 17 and download Maven 3.8.3 </p>
<p> Essentially, the easiest way to work around with this program would be by using IntelliJ </p>
