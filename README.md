<h3>Quickbase Application</h3>
<hr/>
<p> In order to run the program, you have to execute the <strong>QBApplication-Maven-1.0.SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar</strong> which could be found in the <strong>target</strong> directory. </p>

<p> <strong> NB! </strong> If Maven throws errors when trying to build or test, please, change the version of your Java to 17 and update Maven to 3.8.3 </p>
<p> Essentially, the easiest way to work around this program would be by using IntelliJ and the Lifecycle tasks found in the Maven option menu</p>
