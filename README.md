<p> <strong> NB! </strong> Project is built to be run with <strong>JDK 11</strong> (Rolled back from JDK 17 for better compatibility with installed Maven versions) and <strong>Maven 3.6.3</strong></p>
<p> Essentially, the easiest way to run the tests would be by using IntelliJ and the Lifecycle tasks found in the Maven option menu</p>
